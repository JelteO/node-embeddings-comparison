# Node Embeddings Comparison: Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, and GAT

This repository contains the code and experiments for our research paper:

**"A Comparative Study of Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, and GAT in Network Science"**  
by **Jelte Oldenhof** and **Burak AÄŸaÃ§han**, LIACS, Leiden University.

---

## Overview

We compare three popular embedding techniquesâ€”**Node2Vec**, **GraphSAGE**, and **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**â€”for tasks such as **node classification** and **link prediction** on various datasets.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets

Please download the following `.mat` files and organize them in the `Datasets/` directory as shown below before running the experiments:

Datasets/
â”œâ”€â”€ BlogCatalog/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blogcatalog.mat
â”œâ”€â”€ PPI/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PPI.mat
â””â”€â”€ Wikipedia/
â””â”€â”€ POS.mat


1. **Wikipedia Co-occurrence Graph**  
   - **File**: `POS.mat`  
   - **Folder**: `Datasets/Wikipedia/`  
   - **Description**: A word co-occurrence network where nodes represent words and edges represent co-occurrences within a context window.  
   - **Download Link**: [Wikipedia Dataset](https://github.com/allenhaozhu/REFINE/tree/main/data)

2. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network**  
   - **File**: `PPI.mat`  
   - **Folder**: `Datasets/PPI/`  
   - **Description**: A biological network where nodes represent proteins and edges represent interactions between them.  
   - **Download Link**: [PPI Dataset](http://thebiogrid.org/download.php)

3. **BlogCatalog Social Network**  
   - **File**: `blogcatalog.mat`  
   - **Folder**: `Datasets/BlogCatalog/`  
   - **Description**: A social network graph where nodes represent bloggers and edges represent interactions.  
   - **Download Link**: [BlogCatalog Dataset](https://datasets.syr.edu/datasets/BlogCatalog3.html)

**Instructions**:  
- Create the following subfolders within the `Datasets/` directory: `BlogCatalog/`, `PPI/`, and `Wikipedia/`.  
- Place the respective `.mat` files in their corresponding subfolders as shown above.
